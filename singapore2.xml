Hopelessly alone now, she decides to take care of the matchmaking agency long enough to decide what to do with it. But time is running out: Alex has secured employment at a major advertising firm, and is slated to start work in 2 months. Through a circus of colourful characters and strange circumstances, Alex finds herself growing and bonding with the business, and comes to the realisation that it might not be the outright crass and shady business she always assumed it to be, but a legitimate outlet for souls in pursuit of companionship and better lives.</desc><episode-num system="xmltv_ns">0.3.</episode-num></programme>

As she creates a contemporary fashion spread inspired by Vickies work, secrets from her past are revealed. Doris Young aka Marrie Lee played the role of 1970s B-movie icon, Cleopatra Wong but vanished after catapulting to fame. Years later, we uncover her comeback through an amateur film club.
